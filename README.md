# Your Move

Hi! I'm glad you're here. I've never made a game before, so here we go. I hope you have fun with my amateur and satirical game.

## About

Your Move by Sai Vidyasri Giridharan satirizes techno-solutionist embodiments of design that render real the ableist, classist, and gendered notions of the body through “steps” to health.
The game, Your Move follows this joy and centers attention on how a wearable fitness device determines, expects, and measures your physical movement and even your place in the world. The game critiques how the tracker’s premise promotes a form of agency to shift your body from one place to another for achieving one’s health and fitness goals, or to put bluntly, that a body by default is non-disabled. Your Move begins a dialogue about design norms, algorithmic biases, and social assumptions that constitute the making, wearing, and experience of such devices so that future iterations and interventions in this realm are inclusive, accessible, affordable, community-centred, and responsive to agentic difference.
